# Empirical Valence Bond in Python with OpenMM and VeloxChem

## Description

This project uses the Empirical Valence Bond (EVB) method for simulating chemical reactions. It aims to provide a user-friendly and interactive approach to computational chemistry, allowing users to explore and understand the underlying theory while simulating embedded molecular systems of real biochemical and technical interest.

## Installation

This project uses a `EVB.yml` file for managing dependencies. To install, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine and move to the directory

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.*git
    cd your-repo-name.git


3. Create a new Conda environment using the `EVB.yml` file and activate it

    ```bash
    conda env create -f evb.yml
    conda activate evb

## Usage
After installation, you can run the code of the project, see the python notebook for details
