    "The goal of Empirical Valence Bond(EVB) theory is to explicitly calculate the effects of the environment on a chemical reaction. This is of great value in the research of catalysts and enzymes. EVB does this through a free energy perturbation (FEP) using molecular mechanics force fields. An FEP however not capture the chemical bond energy, which is added post hoc from reference data. This added correction generalises across multiple environments, which allows for obtaining new results. The workflow is thus as follows\n",

    "The recalculation is performed to get accurate energies while speeding up convergence. Constraints that limit the phase space, including automatically added distance restraints, shrink down the reachable portion of phase space, which increases convergence of average properties. However, these forces should not contribute to the free energy. For this reason, after having collected the frames of trajectories, the energy is recalculated with a potential that does not include these constraints. \n",
    "<!-- TODO Furthermore, the nonbonded potential that are used for the recalculation is a soft-core variant.  \n",
    "The standard formulation of the non-bonded potential causes poor convergence. Because equations \\eqref{eq:LJ} and \\eqref{eq:Q} go to infinity as $r$ goes to 0, the endpoint energies that equation  depends on diverge. For example in the \\Snt reaction in the reactant state for $\\lambda=0$, the carbon and chloride are bound and the Morse-potential contributing to $\\mathcal{E}_1$ will be close to the minimum. However, the nonbonded potential between the same atoms contributing to $\\mathcal{E}_2$ will be extremely large, and thus the profile of $\\Delta E$ over increasing $\\lambda$ will be very steep, which causes poor convergence. The soft-core correction presented in Section \\ref{sec:soft_core} solves this issue. The soft-core potential has a finite value at $r=0$, leading to smoother energy profiles. This however causes another problem, as the soft-core potential does not simulate the proper dynamics. To solve this, the system is simulated and sampled using the normal nonbonded potential. After that, the energies of the obtained geometries are recalculated using a soft-core potential. Generally speaking, \\Vsample can be defined as the sampling potential which has hard-core nonbonded interactions, and \\Vrecalc as the recalculation potential which has soft-core nonbonded interactions. This procedure allows to pick and choose which potentials should contribute to dynamics, and which potentials should contribute to the free energy profile. By default the soft-core parameters are set to $\\alpha_{LJ}=0.85$, $\\alpha_{Q}=0.3$, $\\sigma_{Q}=1$, and $p=1/6$ and can be adjusted by the user. \n",
